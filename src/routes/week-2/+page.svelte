    <h1 class="text-3xl">The Mindset of Chris Hadfield</h1><br>

    <p>Through out the book, we can see that Chris Hadfield has always had a positive approach to events that have happened in his life. He has never seen anything that has happened in his life as a negative, making most of the 
        situation he has been put in. Lets go through some of these events and how Hadfield has handled them.</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Fear of Heights</h2>
    <p>
        During his childhood, Hadfield had a fear of heights. Despite this, he and his siblings would regularly jump from the barn into a pile of corn. The important thing here is that he was still afraid of heights 
        but was able to push past it instead of letting the fear immobilize him. Through this mindset he gradually jumped from higher and higher places start from the first story to the roof of the barn. This is an 
        amazing example of how Hadfield was able to push past his fears and not let them control him.

    <p>
        When he was a bit older, he used to fly with his father in his plane. In the summers, they would fly the plane with the top open. His father would do all sorts of stunts such as flying the plane upside down. 
        During this, Hadfield felt the only thing between him and the ground was just the seatbelt holding him in place, but he knew the seatbelt was fully secure in 5 different places. His knowledge drowned out his fear.

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Moving to Star City</h2>
    <p>
        Later in his career, Hadfield became the Director of Operations for NASA in Russia. This meant that he had to move to Star City, a town 2 hours outside of Moscow. This was a big change for Hadfield and his family.
        Most astronauts would have been upset about this, having to country with a different language, culture and freezing winters. Hadfield however, saw this as an opportunity to get a change in his life and expierience
        something new. He was able to see the positive in this situation and make the most of it. Even when he arrived in Star City, he stayed in a local Russian apartment instead of the American built base for the astronauts.
        This allowed him to meet locals and expierience the culture of Russia. This again is a perfect exaple of Him always seeing the positive in a situation and making the most of it.

    <h2 class="text-2xl">Training</h2>
    <p>
        Astronauts have to do alot of training. The trainig is very difficult and can be very stressful. It includes many absurd situations that seem like they might never occur. Most people would have been put off by this
        and would have been very stressed out. Hadfield however, saw this as an opportunity to learn and grow. He saw it as a way to learn how to deal with stressful situations and how to deal with them. He knew that might 
        never even go to space again, but still trained to increase his own knowledge and skills. This again is a great example of how Hadfield always saw the positive in a situation and made the most of it.
        <br>
        He always ready just in case something did happen.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class="text-2xl">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class="">
        I belive Chris Hadfield's mindset is a great example of how we should all live our lives. He always saw the positive in a situation and made the most of it. He never let his fears control him and was always ready
        for anything that might happen. I belive that if we all had this mindset, we would all be much happier and more productive. We as a society would be able to find solutions instead of causing problems.
