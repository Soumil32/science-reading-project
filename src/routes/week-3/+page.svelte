<h1 class="text-2xl font-bold">Learning From Other People's Mistakes</h1>

<p>Chris Hadfield emphasises the importance of learning from your mistakes instead of being shamed of them. Mistakes can be very helpful in avoiding futute repeats of past errors. Lets talk about intaces Hadfield has mentioned:</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Pilots</h2>
<p>
    Chris Hadfield used to work as a army pilot and test pilot. During his years as a pilot he has seen many pilots make mistakes. He has seen pilots make mistakes that have cost them their lives. He talks about meetings
    pilots regularly have where they discuss mistakes they have made and how they can be avoided in the future. This is absolutely crucial as it avoids injuries and dmages that could have been otherwise avoided.
    In the meetings, every pilot shows everything they have done in the past week including all major and minor mistakes they have made. Meanwhile, everyone else in the room is not expected to judge the pilot
    and instead to be listening out for things that can be done in the future to avoid others making the same mistakes. One example Hadfield talks of is a pilot's plane slipping off the end of the runway in Louisiana. 
    The plane only had light damages so the pilot could have kept his mouth shut and no one would have known. However, he decided to tell everyone about it so that others knew that the Louisiana runaway made made of a special 
    type of asphalt which included seashells leading to runway getting slippery when wet. Him sharing this information could have saving countless accidents happening in the future.

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Astronauts and The Creation of 'Flight Rules'</h2>
<p>Similar to pilots, astronauts encounter many mistakes while in simulations and during space missions. However, unlike pilots, astronauts have a much smaller margin for error. Even the smallest oversight can lead to a disaster.</p>

<p>Just like military pilots, astronauts hold meetings where they discuss the mistakes they have made and how they can avoid them in the future. These meetings are attended by everyone involved in the mission. Each little thing astronauts do is put under a microscope and analyzed with heavy criticism. This level of scrutiny is extremely necessary as it allows for flaws to be discovered and addressed on Earth, where they can be solved, instead of in space where they could be lethal.</p>

<p>Since the 1960s, all the mistakes made by astronauts have been recorded with verbosely detailed solutions that can be referred to in the future as the single source of truth. These are called 'Flight Rules'. Flight Rules are followed strictly by all astronauts and are regularly updated to incorporate the latest knowledge and experiences.</p>

<p>Furthermore, NASA uses these 'Flight Rules' to train new astronauts. This exemplifies how mistakes can be utilized to improve the future, as the collective experience and wisdom of past astronauts become invaluable resources for ensuring safer and more efficient space exploration.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Being Blind in Space</h2>
<p>During one of his spacewalks outside the International Space Station (ISS), astronaut Chris Hadfield faced an unexpected and potentially dangerous situation. As he was floating in the vastness of space, he suddenly experienced a sharp pain in one of his eyes. The discomfort was intense, causing his eye to tear up. However, the unique environment of space added an unexpected challenge to the situation.</p>

<p>
Unlike on Earth, tears don't behave the same way in the weightless conditions of space. Instead of flowing down his face as they would under gravity's influence, the tears remained trapped in his eye. This unusual phenomenon
made the pain even more unbearable as the water obstructed his vision and further aggravated the situation.
</p>
<p>
As Hadfield's vision in the affected eye deteriorated rapidly, he faced an alarming predicament. Unfortunately, the problem didn't end there. The trapped tears eventually transferred over to his other eye, plunging him into
complete darkness. Imagine being alone in the vastness of space, completely blind, with only the distant stars and the ISS in sight.
</p>
<p>
In such a perilous situation, maintaining composure and making well-informed decisions is crucial. Hadfield and the ground control team swiftly collaborated to address the emergency. They guided him step by step through a 
series of actions to alleviate the pain and restore his vision as much as possible. With their guidance, he carefully blinked and moved his head to encourage the tears to flow out of his eyes, allowing the moisture to escape
rather than remain a hindrance to his vision.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the joint efforts of Chris Hadfield and the mission control team proved successful. Slowly but surely, his vision started to clear as the tears dispersed into the void of space. Over time, the pain subsided, 
and his sight gradually returned to normal.
</p>

<p>
This incident highlights the numerous challenges and risks astronauts face while working in the extreme conditions of space. It also underscores the importance of effective communication, quick problem-solving, and remaining 
level-headed in the face of unexpected emergencies. Chris Hadfield's experience serves as a reminder of the bravery and resilience required of those who venture beyond our planet's atmosphere in pursuit of scientific discovery 
and exploration.
